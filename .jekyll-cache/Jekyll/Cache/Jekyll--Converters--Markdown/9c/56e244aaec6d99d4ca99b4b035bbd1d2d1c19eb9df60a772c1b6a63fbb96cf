<p>DING ZHEN Going Viral: A Real Sino-Tragedy</p>

<p>To start with, let’s talk about DING ZHEN. He is a man about 20 years old living in Ganzi, an autonomous prefecture in Sichuan province. Recently, he goes viral all around the whole country with his so-called innocent and natural face. People Daily sings of him highly glorifying that he qualifies the representative of the people in Tibet. However, things have become unusual after he suddenly became a topical icon. Many provincial governments sent him invitations publicly through media such as Weibo, inviting he for visits and endorsement. A few seconds later, capital investors sensed the craze and started their heavy investment powerfully.</p>

<p>It’s common that someone rises to fame overnight in Tiktok. But is an online influencer equals a representative? The groups of low-income people and left-behind children are still the wordless majority of us people. Most of them do not have such an innocent and handsome look, let alone an abundant annual income. THEY ARE THE REAL REPRESENTATIVE OF PEOPLE IN SOUTHWESTEN CHINA! However, they were just ignored.</p>

<p>What’s worse, he has set a bad example to children growing up in underdeveloped mountainous areas. Many children now sense that they can change their poverty trap quickly by becoming an online influencer, but anyone with a little common sense knows that this continuous craze is just the tip of the iceberg. After all, the most probable way they can change their situation is to study and work and then move to a city.</p>

<p>Official propaganda institution has been trying to cover the real tight corner by creating a figure of a sunny-looking boy. It will make no difference to people in less developing areas, and will even make the situation worse. Let’s get back to our topic DING ZHEN, an illiteracy boy, a sore of compulsory education, becomes a representative of ethnic minorities and the fruits of development. WHAT A SHAME IT IS! However, no authority seems to think so.</p>

<p>Let’s think about Ding’s future. When some other events obliterate the heat of topics around him in a foreseeable future, where should he go? What will be his interior monologue after he realize the reality that heis just a toolman of propaganda machines?</p>
